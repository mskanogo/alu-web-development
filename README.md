# HTML Basic Project

This project is an introduction to **Front-End Web Development using HTML**.  
It focuses on understanding the basic structure of an HTML document and how web pages are built and rendered by a browser.

## Project Objectives

The main goals of this project are to:

- Understand what HTML is and how it works
- Learn how to create a valid HTML page
- Understand the role of elements, tags, and attributes
- Learn how a browser loads and displays a webpage
- Build multiple linked HTML pages with a consistent structure

## Project Structure

The project contains the following files:

- `base_index.html`  
  A basic and valid HTML file used as a starting template for other pages.

- `index.html`  
  The main webpage containing headings, paragraphs, links, and a clickable image.

- `tweets.html`  
  A secondary webpage that embeds a tweet and links back to the homepage.

## Website Layout

Both `index.html` and `tweets.html` share the same structure:

- A `<header>` containing navigation links to all pages
- A `<main>` section that includes:
  - `<article>` for the main content of the page
  - `<aside>` with a placeholder for future comments
- A `<footer>` containing author information and an external link

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 only  
(No external libraries, frameworks, or tools were used)

## Validation

All HTML files are written to be **W3C compliant** and successfully validate using the official W3C HTML Validator.
