# HTML Advanced Project

This project focuses on building the **semantic HTML structure** of a complete webpage from a **designer wireframe**, without using any CSS or external libraries. The goal is to understand how HTML elements are organized, how semantic tags are used correctly, and how a webpage is structured before styling is applied.

The design used for this project is provided via **Figma**, and the implementation follows the structure shown in the wireframe as closely as possible.
